```
Let's break down the code and analyze each part to understand what the output will be:

# 1. String comparison (s1 and s2):
```java

String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");

System.out.println(s1 == s2);
System.out.print(s1.equals(s2));

```

## s1 == s2: 
The == operator checks for reference equality. Since s1 and s2 are both created with the new keyword, they refer to different objects in memory (even though the contents are the same). Therefore, s1 == s2 will return false.

## s1.equals(s2): 
The .equals() method in the String class checks for value equality, and since both s1 and s2 have the same value "abc", s1.equals(s2) will return true.

## Output:

false

true
# 2. Adding String objects to a HashSet:

```java

Set<String> set1 = new HashSet<>();
set1.add(s1);
set1.add(s2);
System.out.println(set1.size());
```

A HashSet in Java removes duplicates based on the hash code and equals() method. Since s1.equals(s2) is true, the set will treat s1 and s2 as equal, and only one element will be stored in the set1.
Therefore, set1.size() will return 1.

## Output:

1

# 3. Printing the hash codes of s1 and s2:
```java

System.out.println(s1.hashCode());
System.out.println(s2.hashCode());
```
Both s1 and s2 contain the same string "abc". In Java, the hashCode() method for String objects is computed based on the string's value, so both s1 and s2 will have the same hash code.
Therefore, the hash codes will be equal.

## Output (The actual number can vary, but both will be the same):


96354
96354
# 4. Comparison of Person objects (p1 and p2):

## java

Person p1 = new Person("abc", 10);
Person p2 = new Person("abc", 10);

System.out.println(p1 == p2);
System.out.print(p1.equals(p2));

## p1 == p2: 
The == operator checks for reference equality. Since p1 and p2 are created with the new keyword, they are different objects, even though they have the same values. Therefore, p1 == p2 will return false.

## p1.equals(p2): 
Since the Person class does not override the .equals() method, it inherits the default implementation from the Object class, which checks for reference equality (not value equality). Therefore, p1.equals(p2) will also return false.

## Output:

false

false

# 5. Adding Person objects to a HashSet:
```java

Set<Person> set2 = new HashSet<>();
set2.add(p1);
set2.add(p2);
System.out.println(set2.size());
```
A HashSet removes duplicates based on the hash code and equals() method. Since Person does not override .equals() and .hashCode(), the default Object class implementations will be used, which check for reference equality.
Since p1 and p2 are different objects, they will have different references, and therefore, both will be added to the set2.
Thus, set2.size() will return 2.
## Output:


2
# 6. Printing the hash codes of p1 and p2:
```java

System.out.println(p1.hashCode());
System.out.println(p2.hashCode());
```
Since Person does not override the hashCode() method, it uses the default Object class implementation, which generates a hash code based on the object's memory address (reference).
Therefore, p1 and p2 will likely have different hash codes, because they are different objects.
## Output (hash codes will be different, depending on memory addresses):


1769315206
1769315240

## Final Output Summary:

false
true

1

96354
96354

false
false

2

# Key Points:
## == vs .equals():
== compares references (memory addresses) for objects.
.equals() compares values for objects (but depends on the implementation of .equals()).
## HashSet:
A HashSet uses both hashCode() and equals() to remove duplicates. If .equals() returns true, the objects are considered equal, even if they are different instances.
Object's default .equals() and .hashCode():
When you don't override .equals() and .hashCode(), Java uses the default Object methods, which check for reference equality (same memory address). Therefore, even if two objects have the same data, they might be treated as different if they are different instances.
